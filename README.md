# Job-Posting-App-Nebyula
Mission Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. With Nbyula growing exponentially, terraformers are looking forward to expanding their team. Could you help them build a customizable job board? Objectives $ Terraformers and applicants should be able to sign up and login to the app $ Terraformers should be able to post a job listing on a common job board shared between other terraformers $ The listing should contain: title, description (markdown support is a plus), location, deadline, contact phone number and contact email $ Note that these job listings should be presented as cards on a board $ Based upon how far the job listing is from the deadline, the cards should have a color. For simplicity, the listing which are due in more than 21 days should be green, less than 14 days should be yellow and less than 3 days should be red $ Terraformers should be able to rearrange the cards on the board by drag and drop to help them modify the order in which theyâ€™re displayed to the applicants $ Terraformers should be able to archive a job listing $ Applicants should be able to mark their interest on any available and active job listing $ Terraformers should be able to see interested applicants
